## Identifying patterns in Spotify Top 50 Songs 

We aim to identify common features and characteristics of the top 50 most popular songs on Spotify 2020, a commonly used music streaming service. The dataset, provide by Spotify (https://www.kaggle.com/atillacolak/top-50-spotify-tracks-2020), includes the track names and artists of these top 50 songs along with various other descriptive features about the song and its contents (e.g., loudness, instrumentalness, danceability). By identifying common features among these songs, it may improve our understanding of the types/features of popular music and may assist future investigations for predicting individual music popularity.
